# Student Time Management Companion (UX/UI Prototype)

## Overview
This project is a UX/UI prototype of a **smartphone and smartwatch companion application**
designed to help students improve time management, task prioritization, and study consistency.

The project was completed as a **group academic project during the Umuzi XPL program**
and was formally presented as part of the program requirements.

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle with:
- Poor time awareness
- Procrastination and task overload
- Ineffective study planning
- Distracting and excessive notifications

These challenges often lead to reduced productivity and increased stress.

## Proposed Solution
A companion system that:
- Syncs tasks between a smartphone and a smartwatch
- Uses time-blocking to encourage focused study sessions
- Delivers subtle smartwatch haptic reminders instead of disruptive notifications
- Helps students stay aware of how they spend their time

## My Contribution (Individual Role)
Although this was a **group project**, I was fully responsible for:

- Designing the complete UX flow
- Creating all wireframes and high-fidelity screens
- Building the fully clickable Figma prototype
- Implementing interaction logic and usability consistency across the app

## Tools Used
- **Figma** – UX research, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototyping
